# Contributing to Icon2font

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## First-time contributors

Add issue or comment on other issues and wait for the issue to be assigned before you start working on it. This helps to avoid multiple people working on similar issues.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Git-Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`. Please create the branch in the format: `[feat/fix]/<issue-id>-<issue-name>` (eg: feat/176-angular-template)
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/abdelhakimrafik/icon2font/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/abdelhakimrafik/icon2font/issues/new). It's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
